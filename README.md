# Carbide-dissolution-analysis-in-bearing-steels

<p>The proposed tool includes (a) preprocessing steps, such as converting to grayscale, smoothing, thresholding and morphological operations, to improve the results of later processing steps; (b) finding contours and convex hull representation; and (c) calculation of different features, such as volume and size.
